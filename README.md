# git-heckout

## What is it?

`git-heckout` lists your branches and fuzzy matches your given branch name so
that you can check out branches without typing their names entirely in.

For example:

```console
$ git heckout ma
Successfully checked out branch master.
```

## Status

All of the basic functionality is effectively working, but a number of features
have not been added yet.
